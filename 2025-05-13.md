the problem with 什么的问题
Most of these start-ups appear to rely on a common assumption: Loneliness results from a lack of friends, and to make new friends, one should meet new people.
这些初创企业似乎大多基于一个共同假设：孤独源于缺乏朋友，而要结交新朋友，就应该接触陌生人。
Without another shared context or network to put them in regular proximity, consistency is difficult to attain.
若没有共同的社交圈或环境让彼此保持经常接触，“持久性” 就难以实现。
At worst, they're expensive distractions, offering a false promise of shiny new connections at the expense of old pals — the ones who have been there all along.
往坏了说，它们只是昂贵的消遣，以牺牲老朋友为代价，虚假承诺光鲜的新关系——而恰恰是那些老朋友，才是始终陪伴在你身边的人。
